### 2. **Theoretical Calculations**

**Paper Section**: Theory and Design  
**Code Files**: Both Jupyter notebooks

The theoretical framework presented in the paper is implemented in the code:

#### Reflexive Tuning Theory
```python
# Coupling coefficient adaptation
k_x0y0 = df.loc[2, 'k_x0_y0']  # Current coupling coefficient
k_lim = df.loc[2, 'k_lim']     # Limiting coupling coefficient

# Reflected reactance calculation
Req2 = omega0*Vbat*L1_x0y0**0.5*Lr_x0y0*c1*abs(k_lim**2-k_x0y0**2)/(k_x0y0*(Lr_x0y0*Vdc**2-L1_x0y0*Vbat**2*k_x0y0**2*c2**2*c1**2)**0.5)
```

#### Current Control Analysis
```python
# Coupled vs. uncoupled current comparison
I1b_k_x0y0 = # Current when coupled
I1b_0 = # Current when uncoupled (reduced)
delta_I1b = abs(I1b_k_x0y0/I1b_0)  # Current reduction ratio
```

### 3. **Efficiency Analysis**

**Paper Section**: Performance Evaluation  
**Code Files**: Both Jupyter notebooks

The efficiency calculations in the paper are performed using:

```python
# System efficiency calculations
eff_four = (Pout/(Pout + abs(Loss_four_total)))*100    # 4-transmitter efficiency
eff_single = (Pout/(Pout + abs(Loss_single_total)))*100 # Single transmitter efficiency
eff_coil = (Pout/(Pout + abs(Loss_coil)))*100          # Coil-only efficiency
```

### 4. **Comparison with Conventional Method**

**Paper Section**: Comparison and Validation
